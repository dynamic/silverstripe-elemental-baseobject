## Usage

`BaseElementObject` is a versioned DataObject that provides a reusable foundation for managing collections of related content within Elemental blocks. It's designed to be extended or used as a `has_many` relationship in custom Element classes.

### Features

The base object includes:

- **Title** - Text field with optional display toggle (using `TextCheckboxGroupField`)
- **Content** - HTML text area for rich content
- **Image** - Image upload with automatic organization into `Uploads/Elements/Objects`
- **Link** - Configurable call-to-action using SilverStripe LinkField
- **Versioning** - Full draft/publish workflow with GridField extensions
- **Permissions** - Inherits permissions from the current page context

### Common Usage Pattern

Typically used as a `has_many` relationship in Elemental blocks:

```php
use Dynamic\BaseObject\Model\BaseElementObject;
use DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement;

class ElementAccordion extends BaseElement
{
    private static $has_many = [
        'Items' => BaseElementObject::class,
    ];
}
```

### Extending BaseElementObject

For custom functionality, extend the class:

```php
use Dynamic\BaseObject\Model\BaseElementObject;

class PromoObject extends BaseElementObject
{
    private static $db = [
        'Subtitle' => 'Varchar(255)',
    ];
    
    private static $table_name = 'PromoObject';
}
```
