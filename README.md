## Requirements

* dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental: ^4.0
* gorriecoe/silverstripe-linkfield: ^1.0

## Installation

`composer require dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-baseobject`

## License

See [License](LICENSE.md)

## Upgrading from version 2

BaseObject drops `sheadawson/silverstripe-linkable` usage in favor of `gorriecoe/silverstripe-linkfield`. To avoid data loss, install the `dynamic/silverstripe-link-migrator` module as follows:

```markdown
composer require dynamic/silverstripe-link-migrator
```

Then, run the task "Linkable to SilverStripe Link Migration" via `/dev/tasks`, or cli via:
```markdown
vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/LinkableMigrationTask
```

This will populate all of the new Link fields with data from the old class.

## Usage

A base DataObject used in the following Elemental content blocks:

* [Accordion](https://github.com/dynamic/silverstripe-elemental-accordion)
